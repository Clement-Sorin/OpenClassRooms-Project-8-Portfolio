## Description

Last project of the web developer training from OpenClassrooms made to build my own porfolio

## Technologies

- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Libraries

- React Router V6
- 

## Goal 

Starting from scratch, I had to create my own portfolio.

For that, I need to :

1. Design the mockup. I used Figma : https://www.figma.com/design/LcuJU4yq9tHdUQMbfPsSxw/Portfolio?node-id=0-1&t=Vfq9pxJWHckYqsC1-1
2. Set up the front end environment using React, React Router and Tailwind CSS.
