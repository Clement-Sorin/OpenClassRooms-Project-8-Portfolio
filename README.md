# Portfolio V2

<img src="" alt="portfolio-landing page" width="800" />

## Description

Last project of the web developer training from OpenClassrooms made to build my own porfolio

## Technologies

-   React
-   Tailwind CSS

## Libraries

-   React Router V6
-   tsparticles.js

## Goal

Starting from scratch, I had to create my own portfolio.

For that, I need to :

1. Design the mockup. I used Figma : https://www.figma.com/design/LcuJU4yq9tHdUQMbfPsSxw/Portfolio?node-id=0-1&t=Vfq9pxJWHckYqsC1-1
2. Set up the front end environment using React, React Router and Tailwind CSS.
3. Create a useContext to manage the languages and the themes, record the user preference into localStorage or read browser preference to set the app mode
4. Make a custom hook for animations on scrolling, taking html tag ids in parameter
5. Developping the page using the mockup and adapt to responsive
